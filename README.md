# Implementing Change Tracking 
We have several data marts that need to get updated with the daily changes from our main business application database (i.e. our source system). We have been following the truncate and load pattern where we truncate our staging tables and load them with every row from the source system database for selected tables every day. We have built our own custom business logic to figure out what changed, and perform the appropriate updates in our data marts. Given that we are processing every row and not just the ones that changed, the duration of this process is no longer acceptable. We would like to transform our process into one that works like the built-in Change Tracking in SQL Server. We want to query the main business application database and just get the rows that have been inserted or updated. The problem is that all we have to work with is a daily database snapshot of our source system. The tables do have primary keys defined and a LAST_UPDATE column which is a DATE type. Can you provide a solution?
